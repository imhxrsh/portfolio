                    If you ship your cargo FTL, it will be handled in significantly less time. Full truckload shipping
                    eliminates the need to break down, consolidate, or deconsolidate your cargo. As a result, there is
                    less chance of your freight being damaged, and insurance claims are easier to deal with.</li>
                <li><i class="bi bi-dot"></i> <b>High-Speed Delivery :</b>
                    FTL shipping means your freight stays on one truck for the duration of the trip. Thus the truck
                    driver’s primary and only concern is to transport your products to you. This helps us streamline.
                    Streamlines your company's transportation and can greatly speed up the process by removing all the
                    extra steps associated with Less-Than-Truckload shipping.</li>
                <li><i class="bi bi-dot"></i> <b>Suitable for a variety of shipments :</b>
                    FTL is the most convenient and arguably the best way to ship items of more than 4500 kgs or 12 to 15
                    cubic meters. Fragile products or products deemed high risk, as well as hazardous, can be
                    effectively transported by FTL.</li>
                <li><i class="bi bi-dot"></i> <b>Zero Pilferages :</b>
                    JRS guarantees Zero shortages, no thefts, and no damage. Our goal is to deliver the client's cargo

                    A major perk of moving logistics towards digitized means is electronic proof of delivery. We are

                    fleet managers and drivers a like.. By using electronic means, data entry is automatically generated
                    and requires less time and energy than manual data entry. Moreover, it provides drivers with all
                    necessary and relevant information, making their job easier.</li>
